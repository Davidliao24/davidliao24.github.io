BrowserHistory 1 took two attempts for me to get it right. The first attempt I was way over time so I just went back to the screencast to watch for the things I was forgetting about. 

Wods 2 and 3 seemed even easier than BrowserHistory1 because they were even shorter. I got RX time for Wod 2 and AV for wod 3. I think I missed RX time for wod 3 just by a little bit because I had to go back to the screencast mid Wod to find out what I was doing wrong with the navbar.
