MY NAME IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWA!!!! Just kidding everybody. I just couldn't help myself but think of this excellent quote from Sekiro when I started to type "My name is". Here is a quick link to the clip if you want to know what I am laughing about.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FcFwk_S8qI

Anyway, my name is Tingwei David Liao. I chose Management Information Systems as my major because of the upside that it has in today's job market. 
With everything going online due to the COVID19 pandemic, our lives are depending more on technoglogy than ever before.
I am looking forward to learning as much as I can from this course so I can apply it outside of the classroom setting!
